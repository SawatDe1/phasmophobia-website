           <p> The D.O.T.S Projector can be placed on a wall or floor similar to a motion sensor. 
            It emits a matrix of bright green laser points in a small area from the projector. Tier I D.O.T.S Projector additionally can be held and toggled to create a cone of D.O.T.S light where it is pointed. 
            The Tier I D.O.T.S Projector will not work if Flashlights are turned off in custom difficulty settings.

          Your browser does not support the audio element.
          </audio>
          
           <p> The reader can be toggled on to begin reading any emissions. The device's effective range, as well as how the reading is displayed, is dependent on the tier of the EMF Reader.<br>
            <br>
             Holding an active EMF reader within 7.5 metres of a ghost (or 2.5 metres for a Yokai)
             during a hunt on the same floor will attract the ghost. During hunts or when the ghost manifests, 
             EMF readers within 10 metres of the ghost 
            (or higher for a Raiju) will malfunction and display random values between level 1 and 4.
           </p>

           <p> A translucent preview of the Ghost Writing Book opened will appear while the player is aiming at a surface and holding down the Secondary Use key.
             The book will be placed when the key is released.

          </audio>
          
           <p> The Spirit Box can be turned on via toggle. The Spirit Box emits a constant static noise while active.

            The microphone LED/icon will indicate whether or not the Spirit Box is listening (when Push To Talk or Toggle is used), 
            or receiving microphone input (when Voice Activation is used).

          Your browser does not support the audio element.
          </audio>
          
           <p> The thermometer reads out both Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F), with Celsius values on the left side and Fahrenheit on the right. 
            The reading will fluctuate from the actual value by a maximum of +3 degrees, in Celsius.
           </p>

           <h1>UV Light</h1>

          Your browser does not support the audio element.
          </audio>
          
           <p> The UV light can be enabled using the toggle key while holding it. The UV light can be activated at the same time as a standard flashlight, 
            but any visible fingerprints or footprints may contrast poorly and be hard to see under their light.
             The UV light projects purple light and this light is weak relative to flashlights. 
            The Tier I and III UV Lights will not work if Flashlights are turned off in custom difficulty settings.
           </p>

          Your browser does not support the audio element.
          </audio>
           <p> When a video camera is picked up, the flip screen will open automatically. 
            If the player is inside the van, they must get off the van for the flip screen to open. 
            The video camera can be used handheld with its built-in display or placed on a flat surface or a tripod.
           </p>

          </audio>
          
           <p>Toggling on an equipped flashlight will provide a small conical range of light to improve visibility of the environment.
             The flashlight can also be put on the shoulder by cycling to another item,
             allowing its use offhand. When on the shoulder, the flashlight can be turned on or off by pressing the Special key.
           </p>

           <p>A salt container can be used to place salt piles on the floor.
             Each salt container can be used 2-3 times, 
             allowing a maximum of 6-9 salt piles to be placed per game with 3 salt containers. Salt piles can be stacked in the same spot.


             <h1>Crucifix</h1>
           

             <audio controls>

              </audio>
          
           <p>A crucifix can be held in the player's hand, thrown, or placed; the crucifix works in all three situations.
             Holding F will show the default effective range for the crucifix;
             this is a translucent sphere with a radius depending on its tier level (even if the ghost has a different effective range)
